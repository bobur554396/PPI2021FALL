Programming Principles I

What is the programing?



 2 + 3 = 5

1) input (first number, second number)
2) result: sum = first number + second number
Program — list of instructions.


Digital device can not understand Humans language.


Computer’s language (1 / 0):

1) High level language:
SQL, Python, Java, Ruby, …


2) Middle level language:
C, C++, Perl, …


3) Low level language:
Assemble


How can we convert all the languages to machine code (binary code)?   Use some translator?:
1) Compiler - will convert whole instructions at once.
2) interpreter - will concert instructions one by one.



Machine code (binary code): 1 / 0

ASCII:

A - 65 -> binary value
